# Hey, I'm Iyad! 👋  
                
## 🚀 About Me  

Hey there! 👋 I'm your go-to DevOps Engineer at IBM, rocking the AWS world like nobody's business! 🚀 With a passion for cloud migration and modernization, I've architected and developed SRE monitoring tools and unleashed the power of Akamai mapping at a major US airline. 🌟 Talk about smooth flying! Oh, and did I mention the CI/CD infrastructure I built for over 200 applications? 🛠️ Time to production? Tenfold improvement, baby! 💪

But wait, there's more! I can unleash Grafana dashboards and AWS CloudWatch magic that let developers keep a hawk's eye on cluster resources. ⚡️ Allowing my clients to achieve a 70% reduction in time-to-resolution and a whopping 40% boost in system performance, I'm all about making things run like a well-oiled machine. Oh, and I've got the security game on point too, spotting flaws and working hand-in-hand with our security teams to keep everything locked tight. 🔒

Sharing is caring, right? I take charge of documentation and knowledge transfer sessions, spreading the love for our new CI/CD processes. 📚

So, if you're looking for a DevOps guru who's not afraid to make things happen, hit me up! Let's revolutionize the tech world together. 🌍✨
